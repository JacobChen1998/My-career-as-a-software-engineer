# Introduction of this Repository (倉庫介紹)

歡迎大家來到這個Repository，這裡我會呈現在我的軟體工程師生涯做過的一些經歷/專案的成果。這些成果有部分是我在任職的公司完成，也有部分是個人興趣所完成的項目。
因為在職完成的專案屬於任職公司之財產，這裡我不會公開任何的代碼，只會分享我做過的成果。若是我個人因興趣完成的項目，會提供該項目之公開代碼。 😄😄😄

Welcome everyone to this repository. Here, I will showcase the experiences and project outcomes from my career as a software engineer. Some of these accomplishments were achieved during my tenure at various companies, while others were personal projects driven by my own interests.
For projects completed during my employment, I will not be sharing any source code as it is the property of the employers. However, I will provide an overview of the outcomes I achieved. For personal projects, I will share the the links of the source code. 😄😄😄
